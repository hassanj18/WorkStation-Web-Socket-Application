Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` for your workstation WebSocket application:

# Workstation WebSocket Application

This repository contains a WebSocket-based application that facilitates communication between a central server and multiple client workstations. The system allows real-time messaging and status updates using a simple and modular architecture.

## Features

- **Real-Time Communication**: Enables clients to send and receive messages from the server.
- **Broadcast and Individual Messaging**: Server can send commands to all clients or a specific client.
- **Status Management**: Tracks the status of each connected workstation (Online/Offline).
- **Multithreaded Operation**: Supports concurrent communication using threading.

## Components

1. **Server**:
   - Listens for incoming client connections.
   - Maintains a list of connected workstations.
   - Sends broadcast or individual messages.
   - Processes workstation status updates.

2. **Client**:
   - Connects to the server.
   - Sends periodic status updates to the server.
   - Listens for and processes server messages.

3. **Communicator**:
   - A helper class to handle sending and receiving messages over sockets.

## File Structure

- `Server.py`: Implements the server functionality.
- `Client.py`: Implements the client functionality.
- `Communicator.py`: Handles socket communication.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher installed.
- Basic understanding of Python socket programming.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/workstation-websocket.git
   cd workstation-websocket
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python Server.py
   ```
   The server will begin listening for client connections on `localhost:4200`.

3. Start one or more clients:
   ```bash
   python Client.py
   ```
   Enter a unique ID for each client when prompted.

4. Use the server's console to send commands:
   - Broadcast commands to all clients.
   - Send specific commands to a particular client using its ID.

## Example Usage

- **Broadcast Command**:
  From the server console, choose the `Broadcast` option and send a `poweroff` command to all connected workstations.
- **Individual Command**:
  Select the `Individual` option, choose a workstation ID, and send the desired command.

## Acknowledgments

- Developed using Python's `socket` and `threading` libraries for efficient communication.
- JSON format used for structured messaging.
